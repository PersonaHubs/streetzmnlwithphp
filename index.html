                <p>StreetzMNL.com and StreetzMNL App purchases can be returned within 30 days (some exceptions apply). To be eligible for a return, items must be in their original condition, unworn and unwashed, with complete accessories, and the original packaging and tags must also be intact and in their original condition. This policy includes custom StreetzMNL By You sneakers.</p>
                <p>Important: To ensure a smooth return process in case of any issues, we highly recommend recording a video of the unboxing process as you receive and open your package. This video can serve as evidence if the product is damaged, incorrect, or missing items, which will help us address your concerns more efficiently.</p>
                <p>And remember, returns are always free for StreetzMNL Members—just make sure you sign in during checkout.</p>

                <p>2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp; By placing an order with us through our site, you acknowledge that your transaction will be with us and not with the respective retailer. You further acknowledge that upon successful verification by us of the authenticity and sufficiency of the information you provide, we will then purchase the merchandise from the respective retailer for the sole purpose of immediately reselling it to you for the amounts presented and agreed-upon when you submitted your order. We will be responsible for fulfilling the order to you.</p>
                <p>2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp; Our site will guide you through the steps you need to take to place an order and make apayment with us. Our order process allows you to check and amend any errors before submitting your order to us. Please take the time to read and check your order at each pageof the order process.</p>
                <p>2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp; After you place an order, you will receive an e-mail from us acknowledging that we have received your order. The Contract between us will only be formed when you receive your order confirmation email. </p>
                <P>2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp; We will send you an e-mail that confirms that the Products have been dispatched ("Dispatch Confirmation").</P>
                <P>2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp; If we are unable to supply you with a Product, for example because that Product is not in stock or no longer available or because of an error in the price on our site or the respective retailer’s site, we will inform you of this by e-mail and we will not process your order. If you have already paid for the Products, we will refund you the full amount including any delivery costs charged as soon as possible and will incur no further liability to you.</P>
                <p>2.7 &nbsp;&nbsp; You acknowledge that we shall be permitted to verify the authenticity and sufficiency of the information you provide, and if we are unable to verify the information automatically, our representatives may contact you and/or your debit or credit card issuing bank to confirm your identity and/or your intent to place the order.</p>

You warrant that all the information provided to us for the purpose of processing payments is correct and you are authorized to utilize the proffered payment method. You acknowledge that we will be entitled to verify the authenticity and sufficiency of the payment information you provide.</p>
                <p>2.10 &nbsp;&nbsp; You acknowledge and agree that we shall conduct pre-payment screening on you and the information you have provided. These checks are designed to prevent eShopWorld from conducting business with a sanctioned individual, entity or country in violation of any applicable laws and regulatory requirements in the territories we operate (including without limitation all customs laws and regulations and export and import controls administered by the U.S. government (including, but not limited to, the Export Administration Regulationsunder the U.S. Department of Commerce), the European Union and any other applicable jurisdiction).</p>
                <p>2.11 &nbsp;&nbsp; We provide the service of determining the appropriate taxes and duties to be applied to the importation of the Product by you, and to collect, report and remit these taxes and duties, as applicable, on your behalf, to the appropriate tax authority. For imports into the European Union and the United Kingdom, the resulting taxes and duties are included in your payment and are paid by eShopWorld and there are no additional costs. By accepting these Terms, you authorise eShopWorld to accept any additional claims for levies (additional assessment) from the relevant customs authorities. For certain non-European imports, you will be responsible for the remittance of taxes and duties to the appropriate tax authority. All Products purchased from us are made pursuant to a shipment contract. Title to the Products shall transfer from the relevant retailer to eShopWorld after exportation of the Products. Title subsequently transfers from eShopWorld to you prior to importation of the Product and you shall be the importer of record (save for delivery to Switzerland, where eShopWorld will be the importer of record). Risk of loss in the Product passes to you when the Product is delivered to you.</p>
                <p>2.12 &nbsp;&nbsp; By ordering Products from us, you hereby authorize a licensed customs broker chosen by us to act as your agent and transact business with foreign revenue authorities to clear your Products, account for duties and taxes on your behalf, if applicable return your Products and if applicable, prepare and submit refund claims on your behalf for any merchandise that you return. Please note that this section 2.12 excludes customers in Canada and Russia; customers in Canada should refer to section 6.10 and customers in Russia should refer to sections 6.11 and 6.12. </p>
                <p>2.13 &nbsp;&nbsp; The price of your order will be quoted including or excluding taxes depending on the delivery address: (a) Products delivered within Canada will be quoted exclusive of sales tax; and (b) Products delivered within Europe will be quoted inclusive of value added tax. Shipping costs are not included in the price; these will be added at the checkout and will be indicated as a separate charge on your order form (except, in circumstances where free shipping is offered).</p>

                <h2 id="cookies">COOKIES and Pixel Tags</h2>
                <p>StreetzMNL collects information, which may include personal data, from your browser when you use our Platform. We use a variety of methods, such as cookies and pixel tags to collect this information, which may include (i) IP address; (ii) unique cookie identifier, cookie information and information on whether your device has software to access certain features; (iii) unique device identifier and device type; (iv) domain, browser type and language, (v) operating system and system settings; (vi) country and time zone; (vii) previously visited websites; (viii) information about your interaction with our Platform such as click behavior, purchases and indicated preferences; and (ix) access times and referring URLs.</p>

                <p>Third parties may also collect information via Platform through cookies, third party plug-ins and widgets. These third parties collect data directly from your web browser and the processing of this data is subject to their own privacy policies.</p>
    
                <p>We use cookies and pixel tags to track our customers’ usage of the Platform and to understand our customers’ preferences (such as country and language choices). This enables us to provide services to our customers and improve their online experience. We also use cookies and pixel tags to obtain aggregate data about Platform traffic and interaction, to identify trends and obtain statistics so that we can improve our Platform. There are generally three categories of cookies used on our Platform:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Functional: These cookies are required for basic site functionality and are therefore always enabled. These include cookies that allow you to be remembered as you explore our Sites within a single session or, if you request, from session to session. They help make the shopping bag and checkout process possible as well as assist in security issues and conforming to regulations.</li>
                  <li>Performance: These cookies allow us to improve our Sites’ functionality by tracking usage. In some cases, these cookies improve the speed with which we can process your request and allow us to remember site preferences you have selected. Refusing these cookies may result in poorly-tailored recommendations and slow site performance.</li>
                  <li>Social media and Advertising: Social media cookies offer the possibility to connect you to your social networks and share content from our Platform through social media.  Advertising cookies (of third parties) collect information to help better tailor advertising to your interests, both within and beyond our Platform. In some cases, these cookies involve the processing of your personal data. Refusing these cookies may result in seeing advertising that is not as relevant to you or you not being able to link effectively with Facebook, Twitter, or other social networks and/or not allowing you to share content on social media.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>For a comprehensive and up-to-date summary of every third-party accessing your web browser (through STREETZMNL Platform or otherwise), we recommend installing a web browser plugin built for this purpose.  You can also choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser settings on each browser and device that you use. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you may not have access to many features that make our Platform more efficient and some of our services will not function properly. There are also general resources for opting out of interest-based advertising available on the website of the Digital Advertising Alliance. </p>

                <p>Similarly, you can adjust your advertising preferences on your mobile device at the device level.  For example, to adjust your advertising preferences in iOS, visit Settings > Privacy > Advertising > Limit Ad Tracking. To adjust your advertising preferences in Android, visit Settings > Google > Ads > Opt out of interest-based ads.</p>

You may access the Platform through a computer, mobile phone, tablet, console, or other technology, which we refer to here as a “Device”.  Your carrier's normal rates and fees apply to your Device.</p>
        
              <p>These Terms create a legally binding agreement between you and STREETZMNL and its affiliates (which we may refer to as “STREETZMNL,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) regarding your use of the Platform. Please review our List of Local Entities for the name of the STREETZMNL entity responsible for providing the Platform to you and the appropriate contact information.

                <ul>
                  <li>Our Terms May Change.  Some jurisdictions do not permit unilateral updates or changes to consumer terms, so this paragraph may not apply to you.

Read through any changes, and if you don’t agree to them, please stop using the Platform.

                </ul>

                </ul>

              <h4>2.  OWNERSHIP OF CONTENT</h4>
              <p>Except for User Content (defined below), all of the content on our Platform - including text, software, scripts, code, designs, graphics, photos, sounds, music, videos, applications, interactive features, articles, news stories, sketches, animations, stickers, general artwork and other content ("Content") - is owned by STREETZMNL or others we license Content from, and is protected by copyright, trademark, patent and other laws. STREETZMNL reserves all rights not expressly described in these Terms.</p>
        
                <ul>
                  <li>All trademarks, service marks and trade names (e.g., the STREETZMNL name and the Swoosh design) are owned, registered and/or licensed by STREETZMNL.  You do not acquire a license or any ownership rights to any trademarks, service marks, or trade names through your access or use of the Platform or Content.</li>

You do not acquire any ownership rights in the Content (including any trademarks or other intellectual property included in the Content), and all such Content is intended for personal, non-commercial use.  STREETZMNL reserves the right to monitor your use and to alter or revoke this license or your access to the Content at any time and for any reason.  STREETZMNL reserves the right to take down any Content in violation of these terms or STREETZMNL’s intellectual property rights.  STREETZMNL allowing you this limited use does not constitute a waiver of any of STREETZMNL’s rights to the Content. </li>
                  <li>Outside of the specific usage rights granted to you by STREETZMNL in connection with the Platform, you agree not to use, copy, edit, translate, display, distribute, download, transmit, sell, create derivative works of, or in any way exploit any Content, including User Content (unless it is your own User Content that you legally post on the Platform), without STREETZMNL’s prior written consent. Unauthorized use of the Content may constitute a breach of copyright, trademark or other intellectual property laws and may subject you to criminal or civil charges and penalties.</li>
                </ul>

              <h4>3.  POSTING CONTENT ON THE PLATFORM</h4>

Some parts of the Platform allow you to post photos, videos, comments, and other content, which we refer to as “User Content.”  STREETZMNL is not responsible for User Content others post to the Platform. User Content is owned by you or whoever created it, but when you post User Content you license it to STREETZMNL as described below:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>You represent that you have the right to post your User Content, and you grant STREETZMNL a non-exclusive, perpetual, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any of the User Content that you post on or in connection with the Platform, including the likeness of any person that appears in the User Content, or any of the concepts or ideas contained in the User Content, for any purpose, including commercial use, which includes the right to translate, display, reproduce, modify, create derivative works, sublicense, distribute and assign these rights. STREETZMNL may, in its sole discretion, remove any User Content at any time. </li>
                  <li>You understand that deleted User Content may persist in STREETZMNL’s systems and on the Platform to the extent your User Content has been publicly posted or shared with others who have not deleted it, unless you or the relevant individual request deletion or blocking of personal data in accordance with applicable law. </li>
                </ul>

              <p>LICENSE TO USE COMMENTS, FEEDBACK AND IDEAS.  You understand that any comments, feedback, or ideas you send us are provided on a non-confidential basis and you grant to STREETZMNL a perpetual, worldwide license to use all comments, feedback and ideas you may share with us, without notice, compensation or acknowledgement to you, for any purposes whatsoever, including, but not limited to, developing, manufacturing and marketing products and services and creating, modifying or improving products and services.</p>

You may be able to connect with these Third Parties through the Platform, but this does not mean STREETZMNL endorses, monitors or has any control over these Third Parties or their activities, which are subject to separate terms of use and privacy policies.  You should carefully review any Third Party’s sites and terms of use and privacy policy. STREETZMNL is not responsible for the content, policies, or activities of Third Parties and you interact with Third Parties at your own risk.</p>

                </ul>

              <p>WARRANTY DISCLAIMER.  Some jurisdictions do not permit certain limitations or exclusions on liabilities, legal warranties and remedies, so these exclusions and limitations may not apply to you.</p>

              <p>Indemnification and RELEASE.
